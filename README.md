### Approach

#### MVP - Minimum Viable Product:

1. Play, pause, previous song, next song
2. Respective text displays update accordingly (song title & artist)
3. Responsive slider (update audio and timer display on click)

#### CSS and UI

1. Layout and styling (based on prototype image below)
2. Rotating cassette tape rollers when a song plays
3. Indication of active buttons (shuffle on / repeat on = colour change)
4. Animated gradient background

#### Possible Improvements

1. Volume control
2. Previous song button with shuffle on: instead of bringing users to the song played previously, it returns to "shuffle-off" mode, returning to the song before the song currently playing. (original song order)
